# Project: Eyes tracking Mouse Cursor in Javascript and CSS

:ceuta_melilla: [README.md en Espa√±ol](README-ES.md)
## Description

The Eyes Tracking Project is part of assignments in the Week 8 of the [Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN](https://xpro.mit.edu/programs/program-v1:xPRO+PCCx+R1/). In this project, I use javascript along with CSS to show how the Iris of the Eyes track the cursor and how we can quickly create multiple instances of Eyes.

## Future improvements

The future features and improvements that I want to do are:
